# Requirements

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

# Setup
To simplify the set up we use [Makefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile). On Linux makefiles are supported by default. If you use Windows, simply look up the command in the Makefile and execute it line by line in your Terminal.  
  
To get started as quickly as possible:
	- enter `make up` in the terminal

Then you should be able to reach HomeAssistant at http://localhost:8123.
